# IMDB Search Toll

Introduction
------------

A tool that let's you search the IMDB database for a movie, and get details for the closest match. This is a clean and simple to use tool, that works by scraping the IMDB website for details about the required movie.

Movitation
----------
IMDB doesn't have an official API that allows searching its database. Additionally, all the other tools availible are either paid or work only for javascript. These were the problems I encountered while I tried to make a movie search tool, and therefore, descided to make a web scrapper for IMDB instead.
